                            <p>Hearing, or audition, is the ability to perceive sound by detecting vibrations, changes in the pressure of the surrounding medium through time, through an organ such as the ear. As with sight, auditory processing relies on how the brain interprets, recognises and differentiates sound stimuli.

                        PROPRIOCEPTION
                    </h1>
                    <p>Proprioception is the sense of the relative position of neighbouring parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement. This sense is very important as it lets us know exactly where our body parts are, how we are positioned in space and to plan our movements. Examples of our proprioception in practice include being able to clap our hands together with our eyes closed, write with a pencil and apply with correct pressure, and navigate through a narrow space.

            </h1>
            <p>Sight or vision is the capability of the eyes to focus and detect images of visible light and generate electrical nerveimpulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. Visual perception is how the brain processes these impulses – recognising, differentiating and interpreting visual stimuli through comparison with experiences made earlier in life. </p>

            SMELL
        </h1>
        <p>Smell or olfaction is our ability to detect scent – chemical, odour molecules in the air. Our olfactory system begins in our nose which has hundreds of olfactory receptors. Odour molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitement is interpreted by the brain to perceive the ‘smell’.

            How olfactory information is coded in the brain to allow for proper perception is still being researched and the process is not completely understood, however, what is known is that the chemical nature of the odorant is particularly important, as there may be a chemotopic map in the brain. </p>

            TASTE
        </h1>
        <p>Touch, or somatosensory, is a perception resulting from activation of neural receptors, generally in the skin including hair follicles and a variety of pressure receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.).
        
            The somatosensory system is a diverse sensory system that is spread through all major parts of our body. At its simplest, the system works when activity in a sensory receptor is triggered by a specific stimulus (such as heat); this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body and this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location.

        <p>The vestibular system explains the perception of our body in relation to gravity, movement and balance. The vestibular system measures acceleration, g-force, body movements and head position. Examples of the vestibular system in practice include knowing that you are moving when you are in an elevator, knowing whether you are lying down or sat up, and being able to walk along a balance beam.</p>

            INTROCEPTION

        <p>Interoception is the collection of senses providing information to the 
                                organism about the internal state of the body. This can be both conscious and 
                                subconscious.It encompasses the brain's process of integrating signals relayed from 
                                the body into specific subregions—like the brainstem, thalamus, insula, somatosensory, 
                                and anterior cingulate cortex—allowing for a nuanced representation of the physiological 
                                state of the body.This is important for maintaining homeostatic
                                conditions in the body and, potentially, facilitating self-awareness.</p>
